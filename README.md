# Semi-automatic-parking-system
Master Group Project
The aim of the project Semi-Autonomous Parking System (SAPS) is to increase the safety and comfort while parking in environments where it is difficult to park or steer a car. This project aims to develop semi-autonomous parking system by developing a small mobile robot as a model. It is important to note that unlike the Fully Autonomous Parking System, in SAPS the longitudinal velocity is provided by the driver. The small prototype mobile robot can detect objects, obstacles and a parking space wherein a parking maneuver can be executed. In the first stage, an ultrasonic sensor scans the environment to find a sufficient parking space. If a sufficient parking space is found, the robot performs different parking maneuvers depending on the value of ultrasonic sensor i.e. how far the mobile robot is from the adjacent vehicle. In the last stage it moves to a correct parking position by avoiding collision with the front and rear obstacles.
